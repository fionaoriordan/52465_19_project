### **Overview**
This repository is my submission for Project 2019, Module 52445: Programming DA Project Data set simulation. This project's objective is to select one real-life phenomenon that can be meausured using at least four variables and at least 100 data observations, to examine the variables, their possible distributions and inter-relationships, similuate a data set based on these findings and finally implement in a Jupyter notebook.  

The project will explore and similuate families' individualised disposabable income and 3 year old family members BAS Naming Vocabulary tests in a Jupyter notebook [52465_19_project_dep1.ipynb]!(52465_19_project_dep1.ipynb). In addition, the simulation will include families household composition, gender of the lead family member, employment status of the lead family member and their relationship with deprivation both economic and educational will be examined and similuated.  The section Research documents the research performed and the rationale for the variables' distributions used. The Data Generation focuses on generating arrays to be used later in the dataframe creation. The dataframe creation section creates an intial dataframe using the arrarys constructed in data generated and some defaults. This section also then updates some of the variables based on logic explained within.  Finally, references are included.
